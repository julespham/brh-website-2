I started my journey in Robotics under [Pito Salas](https://bostonrobothackers.com/members/member_template.html) with the Brandeis Autonomous Robotics course. During my time at Brandeis University I worked as a Teaching Assistant for the course, and a Research Assistant in the lab. Since graduation, I worked at [Vecna Robotics](https://www.vecnarobotics.com/) for 2 years as a Robotics Simulation Engineer. There, I developed the core simulation used for testing autonomous forklifts for warehouse use cases. In Febuary of 2025 I moved to working at [Symbotic](https://www.symbotic.com/) where I have been developing simulations for robotics fleet software used for managing, routing, and tasking fleets of robots in a warehouse storage structure.
