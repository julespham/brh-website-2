Hey! I'm a Computer Science graduate from WPI working on path-planning at Amazon Robotics. In my free time, I've been building small robots to automate home chores. I have interests in human-robot interaction, and machine learning. Feel free to reach out over LinkedIn, or at [my full name]@gmail.com
