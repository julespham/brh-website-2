I am a Master's student in Robotics at Northeastern University, Khoury College of Computer Sciences, specializing in computer vision and robotic perception. My research focuses on vision-only sensing for robotics, including projects on spectral ratio estimation, multi-illuminant color constancy, and vision-only based perception.  

I am also a Graduate Researcher at [NeuMove Lab](https://neumove.org/), I work on vision-based human motion capture and neuromechanical modeling, focusing on developing accurate, markerless tracking pipelines. My work integrates multi-camera setups, advanced computer vision algorithms, and biomechanical simulation to analyze and model human movement for rehabilitation and performance applications.
