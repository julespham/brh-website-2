I am a Robotics graduate student at Northeastern University with a focus on space robotics, autonomous systems, and formal verification. I am the lead developer of [Space Station OS](https://github.com/space-station-os/space_station_os), an open-source operating system for simulating and controlling space station subsystems, inspired by real-world spaceflight architectures.  

My work spans ROS 2 system design, Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) simulation, and advanced control strategies such as Model Predictive Control. I am passionate about making realistic space station technology openly accessible, fostering collaboration among researchers, students, and enthusiasts worldwide to advance the future of human spaceflight.
