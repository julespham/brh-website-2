An autonomous plant care robot designed to revolutionize indoor gardening through intelligent monitoring and care. This second-generation prototype combines computer vision, environmental sensing, and machine learning to create a comprehensive plant health management system. Built on ROS2 Humble with custom navigation and manipulation packages. The system uses OpenCV for plant health analysis through leaf color and growth pattern recognition.
