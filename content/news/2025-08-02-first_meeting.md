Last month on July 31 we had our first meeting of BRH at the Artisan's Asylum in Alston. We had about 25 people at the meeting which is pretty good for a first meeting. 

We kicked off with five or so show-and-tell demos. Pito introduced himself and shared some facts about BRH and the current membership. Here's the presentation. And then Buddy E gave a talk all about servos. Here is Buddy's presentation.
