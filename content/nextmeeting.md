### Show and Tell

Bring your projects, half-bui;t experiments, cool discoveries and tools. Give a 1 minute pitch on what you brought

### Featured Speaker: Space Station OS

Space Station OS (SSOS) is an open-source ROS2-based platform designed to unify the development, real-time control, and scalable automation of modular space station subsystems. From life support and thermal regulation to guidance, power, and communication, SSOS treats the space station as both a smart habitat and a robotics platform, enabling intelligent, autonomous behaviour across all critical domains.

Inspired by how ROS revolutionised robotics by replacing siloed, expert-only tools with a global, reusable software ecosystem, SSOS brings that same open innovation model to space infrastructure. Just as ROS 2 became the backbone of modern robotics, SSOS aims to become the foundational OS for future off-world habitats, modular, autonomous, and built by a global community.
