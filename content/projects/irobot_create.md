Using an iRobot Create-II as a base and a Neato XV11 lidar (Replaced by a SICK lidar), this is a simple ROS2 development platform for me to learn SLAM.

I started it just before COVID and then couldn't work on it at home because the dog IMMEDIATELY attacked it everytime it moved.
Restarted in 2025 so I updated to a new Raspberry PI and ROS2.
I'm just getting back to where I was when I stopped the ROS1 implementation.
