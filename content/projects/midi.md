excerpt: A light organ for my organ

Arduino project reads a MIDI keyboard outputs, then lights up a Neopixel strip in the corresponding location.  Various options include what color to display, and decay time.  I like blinky lights.

I 3d printed a case for it - a clam-shell box with a build-in hinge that prints in place, one of my advanced designs with Tinkercad.
